## About
A React app called Pride Match, where the LGBTQIA+ community and allies can find teammates/friends to game and connect with! Users can browse through a selection of games and add teammates who play the same games and share similar interests shown on their profiles. Their profile can also display their gender, pronouns, and orientation.

The recommendations page suggests teammates based off the users' mutual teammates and other potential 
teammates' interests and games. If a user is not logged in, then random teammates will be displayed.

Pride Match also has a Forums page with game and general categories. The games forum is where the 
community can converse about games while the general forum is for any other topic. As an extra features, 
we would have implemented forums to have their own chat so that users can easily interact with one another 
and potentially become teammates.

For login, users can login with their Google account. If it is their first time logging in with their Google 
account, they will be prompted to complete the rest of the registration form such as filling in their orientation 
(optional), listing the games they play, linking their social media, etc.
